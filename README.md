ShopsRUs Retail Store Discounts


ShopsRUs Retail Store Discounts

ShopsRUs is an existing retail outlet. They would like to provide discount to their customers on all their web/mobile platforms. They require a set of APIs to be built that provide capabilities to calculate discounts, generate the total costs and generate the invoices for customers

The following discounts apply:

If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount).
The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.
Write a program in a programming language of your choice with test cases such that given a bill, it finds the net payable amount. Create an RESTful API which when given a bill it returns the final invoice amount including the discount. Please note the stress is on object oriented approach and test coverage. User interface is not required.
